# Student Record Project

## Overview

This is a mini project focused on practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while exploring the concepts of local storage. The project involves creating a simple student record system where user input details are collected, stored in local storage, and displayed in a table. Additionally, the project includes a functionality to delete specific student details from the table.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Structure

```
|-- index.html
|-- style.css
|-- script.js
|-- README.md
```

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the web page, including the form for entering student details and the table for displaying the records.

- `style.css`: Defines the styles for the HTML elements to enhance the visual appearance of the web page.

- `script.js`: Implements the functionality to handle user input, store data in local storage, and dynamically update the table with the stored student details. It also includes the logic for deleting specific records.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-record-project.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and interact with the student record system.

3. Enter student details in the provided form and click the "Add Record" button to save the information.

4. The entered details will be displayed in a table below the form.

5. To delete a specific student record, click the action button associated with that record.

## Local Storage Concept

The project utilizes the browser's local storage to persistently store the student records. This allows the data to be retained even if the user refreshes the page or closes the browser.
